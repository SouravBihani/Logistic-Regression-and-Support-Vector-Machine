# Logistic-Regression-and-Support-Vector-Machine
Implement Logistic Regression and give the prediction results. • Use the Support Vector Machine (SVM) toolbox sklearn.svm.SVM to perform classication. • Write a report to explain the experimental results with these 2 methods. • Extra credit: Implement the gradient descent minimization of multi-class Logistic Regression (using softmax function).
